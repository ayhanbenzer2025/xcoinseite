              <p className="p-small opacity-70">
                Every XXX Token equals one vote. Voting takes place on-chain using secure, auditable smart contracts. Once a proposal is live, Members have a fixed voting period to cast their decision. All results are recorded permanently and cannot be changed. No manipulation, no backroom deals. Some proposals may require a simple majority, while others — such as protocol upgrades or treasury deployments — may require a supermajority to pass.

              <h3 className="h-small">How do proposals work?</h3>
              <p className="p-small opacity-70">
                Any Member can create a proposal. You don't need to be a developer or a technical expert. Simply describe the change, explain why it matters, and how it benefits the community. Once submitted, the proposal is reviewed for formatting and basic feasibility. If it is clear, valid, and relevant, it will proceed to a community vote.

              <p className="p-small opacity-70">
                Just hold an XXX Token. That's it. There's no registration, no KYC, and no centralized gatekeeping. The moment your wallet contains at least one token, you are a recognized Member of XXX DAO.
