Because what Xcoin is being built for is already happening. Right now. All over the world. People are being censored, blocked, and punished. Not just for what they have done, but also for how they think, who they support, or what they believe.<br/><br/>Or worse, because someone in power decided to flip the switch without warning or explanation. People just try to move money. Communicate. Escape. Survive. And they hit walls. Surveillance. Blacklists. Frozen accounts. This can only happen because you gave others the power to decide what you're allowed to do. The tools you need to protect yourself do not exist until someone builds them. <br/><br/>To understand that, you do not need a roadmap or a whitepaper. You just need to realize what is going on.`,
